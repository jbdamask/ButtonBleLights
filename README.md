## TouchBleLights
Code for Adafruit Feather Bluefruit 32u4 with MPR121 capacitive touch breakout. This code allows for the control of attached NeoPixels by either touch or Bluetooth Low Energy. Touch events are packaged into a payload and written to UART TX for use by listeners.

Also uses NeoPixel RBGW

## ToDo
* Cusotmize device name. https://learn.adafruit.com/bluefruit-le-micro-atmega32u4-microcontroller-usb-bluetooth-le-in-one/ble-gap#at-plus-gapdevname
* Eventually, clean up the code. As I've been writing while learning and experimenting, this is a freaking mess. Don't hate
